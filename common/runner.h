// Pakcet-processing is modeled as a 3-stage task, where the 1st and 3rd stages
// are stateless and can be parallized arbitrarily, but the 2nd stage is stateful
// and must be sequentially exeucted on the same thread. The 3 stages are named
// prologue, solo and epilogue.
// Runner is responsible for:
// * keep track of message receiving order, and process solo stage in the same order
// * monitor solo stage throughput, and "behave" an equal overall throughput
// Specific speaking, when pushing packet into prologue stage, runner will keep
// blocking until enough number of packets finish solo part. In another word, runner
// keeps a upper bound of packets in prologue or solo stages.
